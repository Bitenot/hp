Just don’t get into my head
when I’m standing on the edge.
Standing on the edge.

Just forget me
when you’re looking up at me from below.
Please, just leave me be,
Don’t make me love,
Just forget me,
Don’t make me remember.
Please, just leave me be,
Don’t make me love,
Make me love.... 
Just forget me.
Just... 
Forget!
